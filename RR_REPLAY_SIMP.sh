# The size of a replay campaign is controlled by many limiters.

# - the "exit" file   last_batch_workdir/exit
#   This file does not exist after rqg_batch.pl was called.
#   But as soon that file gets created by the user or similar rqg_batch.pl will stop all RQG runs.
# - Stop of testing as soon the elapsed runtime of testing campaign exceeds the value assigned to
#   --max_runtime or the default of 432000 (in seconds) = 5 days
#   We set "--max_runtime=$MAX_RUNTIME" in the current script.
#   Focus: Define the size of a testing campaign by a time related limit.
#          This is important for running 'production' like QA.
#          Per experience: total runtime < MAX_RUNTIME + 10s
# - Stop of testing as soon as the number of RQG runs regular finished exceeds the value assigned
#   to --trials or the default 99999.
#   The current script sets "TRIALS=1600" and later "--trials=$TRIALS".
#   Regular means: Not stopped by rqg_batch.pl because of whatever internal reason.
#   Focus: Bad Simplifier config or tests, defect in code of RQG or tools, exceptional bad DB server
#          and experiments
# - Stop of testing as soon as n RQG runs finished with the verdict 'replay' if
#   --stop_on_replay=<n> is set.
#   The current script sets "--stop_on_replay=1" --> n = 1.
#   This is sufficient for the main use cases of the script.
#   The simplifier config file (extension .cfg) to be used here should define which test outcome
#   counts as 'replay'.

# There should be usually sufficient space in VARDIR for just a few fat core files caused by ASAN.

# runner again. So the space comsumption of a core is only temporary.
# The rqg_batch.pl ResourceControl will also take care to avoid VARDIR full.
# If its not an ASAN build than this environment variable is harmless anyway.

# Options (Hint: Please take care that there must be a '\' at line end.)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Remove the logs of RQG test runs achieving STATUS_OK/verdict 'ignore_*'.
#    Their stuff grammar/datadir was not archived and is already thrown away.
#    So basically:
#    Do not assign '--discard_logs' in case you want to see logs of RQG runs which achieved
#    the verdict 'ignore_*' (blacklist match or STATUS_OK or stopped by rqg_batch.pl).
#    The current scripts sets '--discard_logs'.
# --discard_logs                                                       \
#
# 2. Per default of rqg_batch.pl the data (data dir of server, core etc.) of some RQG test
#    replaying a problem or being at least of interest gets archived.
#    In case you do not want that archiving than you can disable it.
#    Please note that rr tracing enabled requires that archiving is not disabled.
#    The current script does not disable the archiving.
# --noarchiving                                                        \
#
# 3. Do not abort if hitting Perl errors or STATUS_ENVIRONMENT_FAILURE. IMHO some rather
#    questionable option. I am unsure if that option gets correct handled in rqg_batch.pl.
# --force                                                              \
#
# 4. Debugging of the rqg_batch.pl tool machinery and rqg.pl
#    Default: Minimal debug output.
#    Assigning '_all_' causes maximum debug output.
#    Warning: Significant more output of especially rqg_batch.pl and partially rqg.pl.
# --script_debug=_all_                                                 \
#
# 5. "--no-mask", "--mask", "--mask_level"
#    rqg_batch.pl
#    - does not support "--mask=...", "--mask_level=..." on command line
#    - accepts any "--no-mask" from command line but passes it through to Combinator or Simplifier
#    The Simplifier
#    - ignores any "--no-mask", "--mask=...", "--mask_level=..." got from whereever
#    - assigns all time "--no-mask" to any call of a RQG runner
#
# 6. rqg_batch.pl prints how it would start RQG Workers and the RQG Worker started "fakes" that
#    it has achieved the verdict assigned. == There all no "real" RQG runs at all.
#    Example:
#    --dryrun=replay --> All RQG Worker started "tell" that they have achieved some replay.
#    Use cases:
#    a) When using the Combinator see which combinations would get generated.
#    b) When using the Simplifier see how it would be tried to shrink the grammar.
#    c) --dryrun=ignore_unwanted  see a) or b) and how TRIALS would be the limiter.
# --dryrun=ignore_unwanted                                             \
# --dryrun=replay                                                      \
#
# 7. rqg_batch stops immediate all RQG runner if reaching the assigned number of replays
#    This requires that the combinator config file contains a definition of what is a replay.
#    It is a rare used feature.
#    Stop after the first replay
# --stop_on_replay                                                     \
#    Stop after the n'th replay
# --stop_on_replay=<n>                                                 \
#    The current script sets
# --stop_on_replay=1                                                   \
#
# 8. Use "rr" (https://github.com/mozilla/rr/wiki/Usage) for tracing DB servers and other
#    programs.
#
#    Preserve the 'rr' traces of the bootstrap, server starts and mariabackup calls.
# --rr                                                                 \
#
#    Recommended settings (Info taken from rr help)
#    '--chaos' randomize scheduling decisions to try to reproduce bugs
#    '--wait'  Wait for all child processes to exit, not just the initial process.
#    Both settings do not depend on the hardware of the testing box.
# --rr_options='--chaos --wait'                                        \
#
#    rr_options required because of the hardware of the testing box like
# --rr_options='--chaos --wait --microarch=\"Intel Skylake\"'          \
#        Please becareful with the single and double quotes.
#    should be rather set in the file local.cfg.
#
