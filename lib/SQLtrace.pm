package SQLtrace;

use strict;

# Some hints:
# 1. The SQL tracing happens in RQG. This is the client side.
#    Any transmission of data between client and server could suffer from reasons outside of the
#    responsibilities of the client and the server. And that affects the trace got.
#    Example "before execution" tracing:
#       There is at least for no guarantee that the server ever "saw" that statement.
#    Example "post execution" tracing:
#       It is quite unlikely that a result for a query causing a crash will be sent by the server.
#       The RQG machinery might detect a server crash so fast and react with killing the clients
#       so that some entry like "[9298] UPDATE ...  ; COMMIT;" gets written by the client.
# 2. Certain activities, example: InnoDB Purge, are triggered by a crowd SQL commands where the
#    execution and the result was already sent to the client.
#    In short: There might be no direct connection between one SQL and the crash.
#    We might have SQL commands where the result sent back to the client only acknowledges that
#    the order was received and maybe some initial check passed.
#    shutdown ?
#    INSERT DELAYED ?
#    The CREATION of EVENTs gets traced but not when this EVENT becomes active.
#    In short: The main activity happens asynchronous and after reporting success to the client.
# 3. Neither "before execution" nor "post execution" nor "before+post execution" tracing give
#    sufficient information for 100% correct imaging what happened inside of the server even if
#    asynchronous activity would not exist at all.
#    Just a view examples for the most perfect variant "before+post execution"
#    - The sequence
#         entry m:   REAP: ... /* ... Thread1 ...*/
#         entry m+1: REAP: ... /* ... Thread2 ...*/
#      does not guarantee that the server finished the execution of the query for Thread1 first.
#      The OS scheduling has here some inpact.
#    - The sequence
#         entry m:   SEND: ... /* ... Thread1 ...*/
#         entry m+1: SEND: ... /* ... Thread2 ...*/
#         no further entries where a result of one of these two queries
#         server crash
#      cannot help to calculate which of these two queries caused the crash if at all.
# 4. Certain RQG components like many Reporters do not write SQL trace. I am improving that.
#
# So the main point is to pick the right kind of trace for some already exsiting task.

    # This is a variant of "before execution" tracing.
    # Print (only when sending to the server) something like

    # ('19741212122231.044582', 'a', 'u', 'e', '05:40:15.000638');
    #
    # Use case:
    # Try to replay a problem in MTR or some other tool.
    # And if that works well than simplify the amount of SQL.

use constant SQLTRACE_MARKERRORS             => 'MarkErrors';
    # This is a variant of "post execution" tracing.
    # Print (only when receiving the result from the server) something like
    # [9298] SELECT 1 /* E_R Thread1 QNO 10 CON_ID 16 */ ;
    # [9298] [sqltrace] ERROR 1146: SELECT * FROM not_exists /* E_R Thread1 QNO 11 CON_ID 16 */ ;
    #
    # Use case:
    # Try to replay a problem in MTR or some other tool.
    # And if that works well than simplify the amount of SQL.
    # The statements marked as failing are frequent not required for a replay.
    # Hence some replay attempt without these statements could give a sppedup in simplification.

use constant SQLTRACE_CONCURRENCY            => 'Concurrency';
    # This is a variant of "before+post execution" tracing.
    # Print (when sending to the server and receiving the result from the server) something like
    # SEND == Before execution entry, REAP == Post execution entry
    # SEND: [9517] SELECT * FROM not_exists /* E_R Thread8 QNO 17 CON_ID 16 */ ;
    # SEND: [9488] SELECT 1 /* E_R Thread1 QNO 17 CON_ID 9 */ ;
    # REAP: [9517] ERROR 1146: SELECT * FROM not_exists /* E_R Thread8 QNO 17 CON_ID 16 */ ;
    #
    # Use cases:
    # - Hit a problem in some concurrency scenario.
    #   Seeing the overlapping of statement executions might help to find the reason.
    # - Try to replay a problem in MTR or some other tool ...

    # Idea
    # This is a variant of "before execution" tracing. TO BE IMPLEMENTED

    # END ยง
    # Some tool extracting or running such a file could interpret the 'ยง' as statement end.
    # Use case:
    # Try to replay problems in MTR or some other tool.
    # And if that works well than simplify the amount of SQL.
    # The difference to SQLTRACE_SIMPLE is that the SQL trace does not need to be extracted
    # from some RQG log.
