# HINT:
# This build variant is sometimes used. It is
# - uncomfortable for the analysis of bugs because of the "-O3"
# - good for finding bugs where the likelihood to hit them on other builds types
#   (debug/ASAN/UBSAN/TSAN/valgrind/non debug -- compiler optimizations) is lower
# - quite good for automatic simplification of tests
# - quite good for having nice assert or backtrace patterns like often in test simplifications

# Fun finding: The test innodb.alter_foreign_crash which creates 2 tables with 1 row each, then
# kills and restarts the server, takes forever (more than 1 hour) under ./mtr --rr in the
# ... branch. But, once I recompiled with cmake -DPLUGIN_PERFSCHEMA=NO it would complete
# practically instantly. I hope you are normally disabling the performance-loss schema.
# I think that there could have been some mutex acquisition loop, maybe mysql_mutex_trylock or
# whatever, and with PFS there would be a conditional branch on "is PFS enabled at runtime".
# And those are very expensive in rr.
# I canâ€™t attach gdb and rr at the same time, but with sudo perf top -g -p $(pgrep mariadbd) I
# immediately saw some PFS code.

# Do not reset something before the make!

# GCC Docu
# To tell GCC to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost all cases you need only to
# add -g to your other options.
#
# GCC allows you to use -g with -O. The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally be
# surprising: some variables you declared may not exist at all; flow of control may briefly move
# where you did not expect it; some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
# results or their values are already at hand; some statements may execute in different places
# because they have been moved out of loops.  Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized
# output. This makes it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
#
# Append in order to not mangle the file maybe too much
