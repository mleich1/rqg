# Derivate of table_stress_innodb.yy which
# - focuses on DDL algorithm NOCOPY only
# - avoids table rebuilds which would be caused by manipulating col1
#   or TRUNCATE TABLE, ADD DROP PRIMARY KEY
# - avoids BLOCK STAGE because of frequent trouble

# The grammar is dedicated to stress tables with
# - DDL direct or indirect
#   Examples:
#      ALTER TABLE test.t1 ADD COLUMN
#      DROP TABLE test.t1
#      RENAME TABLE test.t1 TO new_test.t1
#      DROP SCHEMA new_test (affects the tables stored within the schema)
#      DROP several tables at once
#      Perform more than change affecting the definition of a table
# - DML trying to modify data and (combine with and/or)
#   - hitting frequent duplicate key or foreign key constraint violations
#   - being in some transaction which get intentional rolled back later
# - DDL and DML being "attacked" by KILL QUERY <session> and KILL <session>
# - DDL-DDL, DDL-DML, DML-DML locking conflicts caused by concurrency
# as efficient as possible regarding costs in
# - grammar development
# - at test runtime
# - in analysis (grammar simplification) and replay of bad effects met.
# In order to achieve that certain decisions had to be made
# 1. SQL statements should be kept as simple as possible.
# 2. No coverage for features like for the example the stored program language.
#    Nevertheless
#    - creating, use and drop of triggers needs to be checked because
#      they are bound to tables
#    - stored procedures might be used for auxiliary purposes
# 3. We focus on coarse grained bad effects like crashes and similar.
#    Some immediate (just after finishing statement execution) and deep
#    (table definition or table content) checking via some validator is mostly
#    impossible because of various reasons.
#
# The current grammar is partially based on the code of conf/runtime/alter_online.yy

# and should become the successor of that test.
#

# Even with threads = 1 an ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN could fail.
# Example:
# ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS col3_copy INT FIRST,
# LOCK = NONE, ALGORITHM = COPY
# 1846 LOCK=NONE is not supported. Reason: COPY algorithm requires a lock. Try LOCK=SHARED.
# Impact:
# 1. 1054 Unknown column '%s' in 'field list' for
#    UPDATE t1 SET col3_copy = col3
# 2. ALTER TABLE t1 DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS col3  works
#    ALTER TABLE t1 CHANGE COLUMN <...> col3_copy col3 INT, LOCK = EXCLUSIVE makes no replacement
#    and the table is incomplete.
# Possible solutions:
# a) Try ALTER TABLE t1 ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS <maybe missing column> and than fill it via
#    UPDATE t1 .... <template column or table> or REPLACE ...
# b) DROP and recreate any working table
#    - after some maximum lifetime and/or
#    - after detecting the defect (no of columns smaller than expected)
#

# Doing that in 'thread1_init' avoids clashes compared to trying it by every thread
# if 'query_init' would be used.

# We are here interested on the impact of
# - killing (KILL ...)
#   - the excution of a DDL/DML
#   - a session
# - giving up the session voluntary (... RELEASE)
# regarding whatever statements being just in execution, transactions open, freeing of resources
# like locks, memory being occupied etc.
#
# Per manual:
#    KILL [HARD | SOFT] [CONNECTION | QUERY [ID] ] [thread_id | USER user_name | query_id]
#    Killing queries that repair or create indexes on MyISAM and Aria tables may result in
#    corrupted tables. Use the SOFT option to avoid this!
#
#    COMMIT [WORK] [AND [NO] CHAIN] [[NO] RELEASE]
#    ROLLBACK ... RELEASE
#
# Observation:
#    KILL <get default which is HARD> QUERY <ALTER TABLE ... ADD FTS INDEX>
#    lets the thread harvest "1034 Create index by sort failed" which
#    RQG valuates as STATUS_DATABASE_CORRUPTION.
# Up till today (2019-05) I am unsure how to fix that problem
# - use SOFT all time (current and maybe permanent solution)
#   Crash recovery testing should cover what is not checked when using SOFT
# - do not valuate "1034 Create index by sort failed" as STATUS_DATABASE_CORRUPTION.
#
#
# The following aspects are not in scope at all
# - coverage of the full SQL syntax "KILL ...", "COMMIT/ROLLBACK ..."
# - will the right connections and queries get hit etc.
#
# Scenarios covered:
# 1. S1 kills S2
# 2. S1 kills S1
# 3. S1 tries to kill S3 which already does no more exist.
# 4. S1 gives up with ROLLBACK ... RELEASE.
#    It is assumed that RELEASE added to ROLLBACK will work as well as in combination with COMMIT.
#    Hence this will be not generated.
# 5. Various combinations of sessions running 1. till 5.
#
# (1) COMMIT before and after selecting in test . rqg_sessions in order to avoid effects caused by
#     - a maybe open transaction before that select
#     - the later statements of a transaction maybe opened by that select
# (2) No COMMIT before and after selecting in test . rqg_sessions in order to have no freed locks
#     before the KILL affecting the own session is issued. This is only valid if AUTOCOMMIT=0.

# For https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-16849 Extending indexed VARCHAR column should be instantaneous
# 1. Since 10.2.2 we get a instantaneous change of the maximum length of a VARCHAR column when the length is
#    increasing and not crossing the 255-byte boundary.
#    When the VARCHAR column was indexed than the indexes would be dropped and added again.
# 2. MDEV-16849 adds
#    The drop+add of indexes gets avoided.
# 3. If in ROW_FORMAT=REDUNDANT, we can also extend VARCHAR from any size to any size. The limitation
#    regarding the 255-byte maximum length only applies to other ROW_FORMAT.
# FIXME: Complete the implementation.

# MDEV-5336 Implement LOCK FOR BACKUP
# ===================================
#
# New SQLs ordered by intended workflow for mariabackup
# -----------------------------------------------------
# BACKUP STAGE START (former stage 1)
#   Start service to log changed tables.
#   Block purge of redo files (needed at least for Aria, not needed for InnoDB).
#   Make a checkpoint for all transactional tables (to speed up recovery of backup).
#   Note that the checkpoint is not critical, just a minor optimization.
#
#   mariabackup can now copy all transactional tables and redo logs
#   Next lock is taken after all copying is done.
# BACKUP STAGE FLUSH (former stage 2)
#   FLUSH all changes for not active non transactional tables, except for statistics and log tables.
#   Close the tables, to ensure they are marked as closed after backup.
#   BLOCK all new write row locks for all non transactional tables (except statistics/log tables).
#   Mark all active non transactional tables (except statistics/log tables) to be flushed and closed
#   at end of statement. When last instance of a table is flushed (and the table is marked as read
#   only by all users, we should call handler->extra(EXTRA_MARK_CLOSED). This is needed to handle
#   the case that somone opens a tables as read only while the table is still in use, in which case
#   the table would never have been closed by everyone.
#   The following DDL's doesn't have to be blocked as they can't set the table in a
#   non consistent state: CREATE, RENAME, DROP
#   CREATE ... SELECT, TRUNCATE and ALTER should be blocked for non transactional tables.
#
#   Next lock can be taken directly after this lock.
#   While waiting for the next lock mariabackup can start copying all non transactional tables that
#   are not in use. This list of used tables can be found in information schema.
# BACKUP STAGE WAIT_FOR_FLUSH (former stage 3)
#   Wait for all statements using write locked non-transactional tables to end. This should be
#   done as we do with FTWRL, which aborts any current locks.
#   This solves the deadlock that Sergei commented upon.
#   While waiting it could report to the client non-transactional tables as soon as they become
#   unused, so that the client could copy them while waiting for other tables.
#   Block TRUNCATE TABLE, CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE and RENAME TABLE.
#   Block also start of a new ALTER TABLE and the final rename phase of ALTER TABLE.
#   Running ALTER TABLES are not blocked.
#   Inline ALTER TABLE'S should be blocked just before copying is completed.
#   This will probably require a callback from the InnoDB code.
#   Next lock can be taken directly after this lock.
#   While waiting for the next lock mariabackup tool can start copying:
#   The rest of the non-transactional tables (as found from information schema)
#   All .frm, .trn and other system files,
#   New tables created during stage 1-2. The file names can be read from the
#   new changed tables service. This log also allow the backup to do renames
#   of tables on which RENAME's where done instead of copying them.
#   Copy changes to system log tables (this is easy as these are append only)
#   If there is a lot of new tables to copy, one should be able to go back to BACKUP STAGE 2
#   from STAGE to allow ddl's to proceed while copying and then retrying stage 3.
# BACKUP STAGE LOCK_COMMIT
#   Lock the binary log and commit/rollback to ensure that no changes are committed to any tables.
#   If there are active data copied to the binary log this will be copied before the lock is
#   granted. This doesn't lock temporary tables that are not used by replication.
#   Lock system log tables and statistics tables and close them.
#   When STAGE 4 returns, this is the 'backup time'.
#   Everything commited will be in the backup and everything not committed will roll back.
#   Transactional engines will continue to do changes to the redo log during stage 4, but this
#   is not important as all of these will roll back later.
#   mariabackup can now copy the last changes to the redo files for InnoDB and Aria, and the part
#   of the binary log that was not copied before.
#   End of system log tables and all statistics tables are also copied.
# BACKUP STAGE END
#   Call new handler call 'end_backup()' handler call, which will enable purge of redo files.
#
# Basic ideas:
# - A sequence of the SQL's above in the right order.  Small sleep between the SQL's?
# - One of the SQL's above diced. (== Wrong programmed backup tool). -- Use rare
# - Two sequence runner. == Use rare --> Check first in MTR

# 1. Have the alternatives
#    a) <nothing>
#    b) IF NOT EXISTS
#    because https://mariadb.com/kb/en/library/alter-table/ mentions
#    ... queries will not report errors when the condition is triggered for that clause.
#    ... the ALTER will move on to the next clause in the statement (or end if finished).
#    So cause that in case of already existing objects all possible kinds of fate are generated.
# 2. "IF NOT EXISTS" gets more frequent generated because that reduces the fraction
#    of failing statements. --> "Nicer" output + most probably more stress
# 3. <nothing> as first alternative is assumed to be better for grammar simplification.
