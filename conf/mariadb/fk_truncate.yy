# The grammar is dedicated to stress tables having a foreign key relationship with concurrent
# - simple DML
# - TRUNCATE
# and was developed for checking patches for https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-13564
# TRUNCATE TABLE and undo tablespace truncation are not compatible with Mariabackup.
# The table "unrelated" serves for revealing if some problem hit requires a foreign key
# relationship or not.
# Its not the task of the test to stress other DDL than just TRUNCATE.
#
# Problems replayed (2018-09):
# - not found in JIRA
#   mysqld: storage/innobase/row/row0mysql.cc:1724:
#   void init_fts_doc_id_for_ref(dict_table_t*, ulint*):
#   Assertion `foreign->foreign_table != __null' failed.
# - https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-16664
#   InnoDB: Failing assertion: !other_lock || wsrep_thd_is_BF(lock->trx->mysql_thd, FALSE) ||
#           wsrep_thd_is_BF(other_lock->trx->mysql_thd, FALSE) for DELETE
#   and that even is "innodb_lock_schedule_algorithm=fcfs" was set.
#   The latter helped in some other replay test.
